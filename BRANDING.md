# DRONER Branding Guidelines (Updated)

This project follows a dark mode, luxurious color palette inspired by a high-tech aesthetic.

## Color Palette
- **Primary Black**: `#000000`
- **Accent Gold**: `#FFD700`
- **Accent Turquoise**: `#008B8B`

## Typography
Use bold, modern fonts such as **Poppins** or **Montserrat** for a clean look.

## Icons and Accents
Minimalistic icons in gold or turquoise tones should be used. Backgrounds are deep black or dark gradients, with gold headlines and turquoise highlights subtly integrated.

Any previous references to the green color `#0AD100` are obsolete.
